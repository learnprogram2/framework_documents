# framework_documents
when I was free, sometimes I will refer to some framework's public documents. nearly all of them are in English, so it's hard to understand for me.
this project I will note the docs I read in Chinease(although I don't want to be a chinease speaker).
> sadly, now I move my notes to bitbucket, for i cannot login github during work. ㄒoㄒ
